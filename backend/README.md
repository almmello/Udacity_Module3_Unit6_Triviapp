# Backend - Trivia API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of Python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This approach keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. You can find instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

```bash
pip3 install virtualenv	  
python3 -m venv venv 	  
source venv/bin/activate  	  
```


3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is set up and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app. py' and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

## Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

"`bash
createdb trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. Then, from the `backend` folder in the terminal, run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory, ensure you work using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

# Development from source files

These are the files you'd want to edit in the backend:

1. `backend/flaskr/__init__.py`
2. `backend/flaskr/models.py
2. `backend/test_flaskr.py`

# Achievement

For each endpoint, was defined the endpoint and response data.

1. Used Flask-CORS to enable cross-domain requests and set response headers. => OK
2. Created an endpoint to handle `GET` requests for questions, including pagination (every ten questions). This endpoint returns a list of questions, the number of total questions, and the current category. =>OK
3. Created an endpoint to handle `GET` requests for all available categories. => OK
4. Created an endpoint to `DELETE` a question using a question `ID`. => OK
5. Created an endpoint to `POST` a new question, requiring the question and answer text, category, and difficulty score. => OK
6. Created a `POST` endpoint to get questions based on category. => OK
7. Created a `POST` endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It returns any questions for whom the search term is a substring of the question. => OK
8. Created a `POST` endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint takes a category and previous question parameters and returns random questions within the given category if provided and that is not one of the previous questions. => OK
9. Created error handlers for all expected errors, including 400, 404, 405, 422, and 500. => OK

# Endpoints Documentation

Find below the detailed documentation of Trivia app API endpoints, including the URL, request parameters, and the response body.

## Base URL

- Currently, You can only run this app locally.
- The default address, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, is used to host the app backend.

## Authentication: 
This application version does not require authentication or API keys.

## Error Handling

The API returns Errors as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```

The API will return five error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method not Allowed
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal Server Error


## GET /questions

# Testing

The test_flaskr.py script uses the Unittest library to test each endpoint success and one error behavior.

To deploy the tests, run:
```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
Python test_flaskr.py
```
